# [Atlassian Companion](https://chocolatey.org/packages/atlassian-companion)

The Atlassian Companion app enables users to edit Confluence files in their preferred desktop application, then save the file back to Confluence automatically.

The download and re-upload of files is managed by the Atlassian Companion app, which needs to be installed on each user's machine (not in the Confluence installation directory) to enable file editing.
